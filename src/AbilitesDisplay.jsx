                            An Android app designed <br/>to bring us closer <br/>
                            to animals. It was <br/>fed with a table <br/>containing thousands of animals<br/>
                             and their information. The<br/> app featured a menu<br/>
                              where you could filter<br/> and search for specific<br/>
                               animals, add new ones,<br/> and take photos using <br/>
                               the camera to display <br/>data about the animal <br/>
                               and whether it is dangerous <br/>(using a trained AI model). <br/>
                               The final option predicted <br/>with 86% accuracy whether<br/>
                                an animal was endangered <br/>based on its height,<br/>weight, and whether it<br/>
                                 was alone or accompanied <br/>when you saw it. <br/>This was achieved <br/>
                                 by cleaning the animal <br/>data table and training <br/>
                                 it with the Random <br/>Forest algorithm, reaching <br/>

                                ones, but the good <br/>ones are longer, while
