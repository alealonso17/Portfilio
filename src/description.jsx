                <p className="DescriptionAboutMe">
                Throughout my journey in software development, 
                I have gained experience in various programming 
                languages, frameworks, databases, and tools. I have 
                worked extensively with Python, C#, and JavaScript,
                 applying them in areas such as web development, 
                 object-oriented programming, and machine learning. 
                 My web development skills include HTML, CSS, and JSX 
                 (React), enabling me to create interactive and 
                 responsive applications. I have experience with 
                 .NET for backend development and React for frontend
                  frameworks. Additionally, I am proficient in SQL 
                  Server and MySQL, understanding core database 
                  principles such as table normalization and SQL 
                  querying. To support my workflow, I actively use Git 
                  for version control and VS Code as my primary 
                  development environment. This diverse technical 
                  background allows me to develop efficient and 
                  scalable applications while continuously expanding 
                  my knowledge. ( For more info open in browser!)
